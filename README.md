 - what is a commit message?

 It is one of the ways that developers communicate with each other. If you or your group is working on a large project, it could be like a story, with each message being a chapter. Below is the command line to execute a commit message:

# Pull Request

- what is Pull Request?

Pull requests are made when someone wants to merge changes from one branch into another. It is a way to protect the main branch or the branch that serves end users.

- Steps to take when you create a pull request

1. Make your changes locally in a separate branch.

2. Push the changes back to your repository.

3. Click the "Compare & pull request" button. This step compares the changes in the branch you just created with the main branch.

4. Click "Create pull request" to open a new pull request.

5. If there are rules set for the main branch, someone from the team must manually review and approve the pull request before merging the branches.

- What was Erick trying to accomplish?

Erick was responsible for adding user greetings and checking their names in the app. He had two files called welcome.js and getName.js.

**getName.js** retrieves the user's age, and **welcome.js** checks their eligibility based on their age and greets them accordingly.
